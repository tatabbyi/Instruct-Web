### Energy Feature
Indicates how much energy the user has for the day. This can be set manually each day or predicted based on recent activity.

### Emotional Support
- Logging emotions  
- Coping mechanisms  
- Identifying possible triggers

## Future Goals
- Jobs  
- Skills  
- Relationships  
- Finding a community  
- Certifications  

This feature will act as a one-stop shop for building a fulfilling life. Users will be able to create simple goals they want to achieve. It is especially aimed at people who have struggled to obtain even basic jobs.  

Helpful videos and questionnaires will be provided to help users gain the skills needed for roles such as store clerk, librarian, cleaner, and more. The user will then be tested on their knowledge in a live round of questions related to the job they hope to qualify for.  

There will be milestone badges and final certifications that can be added to resumes. Basic skills will also be taught through videos and instructions, with an AI chat feature to offer assistance when problems arise. These skills include cooking, fishing, sewing, laundry, and more.  

A streak feature will track how often these skills are practiced, encouraging consistency. There will also be resources on how to make long-term friends and where to find them.  

To help build community, a messaging feature will connect support groups based on shared interests, location, and age. Age verification will be required depending on the group being joined.
